**Base App Template - Flutter Starter Project**

This repository is the **Base App Template** I created to provide a solid starting point for Flutter projects. It includes a well-organized structure using the MVVM architecture, state management with Riverpod, Firebase integration, and multi-language support with EasyLocalization. Here's what the project includes and what I've worked on:

   - Created a `locale_keys.g.dart` file for easily managing localized strings.  

3. **Clean and Modular File Structure**  
   - Designed the project with **core** and **features** layers to ensure scalability and maintainability.  
   - Organized reusable widgets, extensions, and helper files for efficient development.  

4. **State Management with Riverpod**  
   - Implemented **Riverpod** for state management to ensure clean and reactive code.

5. **Firebase Integration**  
   - Set up **Firebase Core** for initializing Firebase.  
   - Configured **Firebase Realtime Database (RTD)** and **Firestore** for database operations.  
   - Integrated **Firebase Storage** for managing media files.  

6. **Theming & Styling**
